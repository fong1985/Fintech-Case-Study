# FinTech in Real Estate
## Overview and Origin
* Name of company
#### [BrickX](https://www.brickx.com/)
* When was the company incorporated? 
#### BrickX was incorporated in June 2014. 
* Who are the founders of the company? 
#### The founder of BrickX is Anthony Millet
* How did the idea for the company come about? 
#### "BrickX intends to redefine how property investors gain exposure to real estate, through a transparent, low touch and accessible way." <sup>(1)</sup>
#### With rising house prices, high interest rates, and complex transactions, many ordinary Australian investors are unable to achieve their dream of owning a property. BrickX makes it possible for people to invest into direct property through fractional property investment. 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
#### BrickX has raised a total of 12.5M in funding over 4 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on 28 February 2018 from a Series A round <sup>(2)</sup>. 
BrickX has raised the following funding:
| Date              | Money Raised | Investor     |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 28 February 2018  | $9M          | NAB Ventures |
| 15 November 2017  | $0           | Reinventure  |
| 12 September 2016 | $2.5M        | -            |
|  1 August 2014    | $1M          | BridgeLane Capital|
## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve? 
#### BrickX allows investors to access the direct property market without having to purchase the entire property. This is beneficial for investors who are unable to afford the high cost of property in Australia. This is achieved by splitting a property into fractions or "Bricks". Investors can then own a share of an asset by paying an agreed amount equivalent to a percentage of the total value. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? 

The main customers for BrickX are property investors and property owners.

Investors can build a property portfolio to diversify their property holdings using the fractional property investing model that BrickX offers. Any rental income and capital gains generated by the property are proportionately returned to the investor. 

Many of the headaches of owning a property are removed for investors such as the large amount of capital required, legal fees, asset management etc. 

BrickX is also beneficial for property owners who are looking to realise a portion of their family home without having to sell 100% of it can engage with BrickX. They can to sell their home to BrickX investors and pay rent to continue living in their family home. This is extremely useful for property owners with the majority of their capital tied up in their family home and no other funds available to them. Selling and renting back their property via BrickX allows them to free up capital to meet their ongoing living expenses without having to relocate. 

* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

As of 24 January 2021 there were 2,207,905 property investors in Australia or approximately 20% of Australian households <sup>(3)</sup>. However, 90% of property investors owned from 1 to 2 investment properties and less than 1% owned 6 or more investment properties. These statistics reflect the difficulty of building a large property portfolio and is one of the problems that BrickX is attempting to solve. 

Using these proportions, the initial market would be 1,987,114 existing investment property investors. 

Another market that BrickX is targeting are those investors who do not have the capital to enter the real estate market. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot
offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

BrickX main competitor is [DomacCom](https://www.domacom.com.au/). DomaCom offer a similar fractional property investment strategy. 

The advantage that BrickX has is their minimum investment amount. Investors can invest with BrickX with as little as $250, whereas DomaCom require a minimum investment of $2,500. This allows BrickX to appeal to a wider audience with budgets ranging in the lower range of the investment spectrum. As well as offering a lower entry cost, BrickX's fees are less than DomaCom. There are no ongoing fees involved with the upkeep of your investment however, buy and sell transactions attract a 0.5% fee. DomeCom charge an ongoing management fee of 0.88% per annum meaning that investors could be paying fees when their property investment is losing capital.

BrickX also offers a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy where a monthly deposit can be split to purchase bricks in multiple investment properties. Utilising this strategy, investors can diversify their property portfolio instead of being committed to a single property. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

BrickX uses the latest technology and equity sharemarket concepts such as Separately Managed Accounts and Managed Investment Schemes, to enable investors to enter the property market in a similar manner to investing in public companies. BrickX selects and buys each property and then allows investors to purchase portions of that property. BrickX has analytical tools and experts helping them choose investments they believe will outperform the average which the average investor will not have access to. BrickX also onboards the ongoing administration and maintance of each property, taking these responsibilities away from the investor. 

BrickX also uses a Managed Investment Schemes or crowdfunding campaign to combine the contribution of multiple investors to purchase an investment property. 

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

BrickX operates in the real estate industry. The real estate industry has been operating since the early 1800s. In the current market, real estate makes up a large portion of individual and business welath across economic sectors. When real estate prices rise, wealth increases, so individuals and businesses are more likely to borrow and spend. When home prices rise, the effects ripple across the economy.

Real estate often is the largest purchase for an individual, couple, family or business. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-
10 years?

    * Online market place: Investors almost exclusively search for potential property investments using popular online market places such as [RealEstate](https://www.realestate.com.au) and [Domain](https://www.domain.com.au). The development of these platforms has allowed seamless for buyers and sellers to exchange information that faciliatate and improve transactions. 

    * Virtual Reality: Virtual reality allows homeowners to view the design and ambience of their new home in explicit detail using 3D virtual reality glasses. This technology has become an advantage for forward-thinking real estate agents, especially when marketing new property developments. Investing in property is a tactile and visual experience and the use of VR allows the end investor to have a virtual "look" and "feel" of their investment. 

    * Big Data: In real estate, big data is non-traditional data that illustrates more granular details about a property such as the amount of light a home receives throughout the day, noise & pollution levels. 

    * Artificial Intelligence: Technology has allowed real estate agents to tap their network of clients for a potential buyer. This placed heavily reliance on the relationships between the agent and their client. Articial Intelligence has the ability to target specific buyers that are a likely match for the property being sold. AI technology is able to develop a targeted marketing campaign that matches potential buyers at a fraction of the cost to the seller.

        AI has also allowed for the use of Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) such as [JLL](https://www.jll.com.au/) which use an algorithm to provide estimates of a real estate property market value at a point in time. This allowas property owners and lenders to make their property related decisions with a high level of confidence.  

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Other companies in this domain would be the bricks and mortar real estate companies selling properties face to face. [Ray White](https/www.raywhite.com) is one of the biggest and oldest real estate companies in Australia. They have over 1,000 individually owned offices and is a family owned business.

DomaCom has already been mentioned as a key competitor in the FinTech space with a model that offers similar services to BrickX. 

[OpenAgent](https://www.openagent.com.au/) is an online Real Estate broker where local agents and companies are ranked in a rating system and presented to buyers and sellers giving them control over who they choose to do business with. OpenAgent uses unique data and customer reviews to match with local agents who have a proven track record of selling similar properties. This allows customers to be in control of the agent selection process.

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are companies that own or finance income producing real estate across a range of property sectors. REITs have exposure to property assets including the following:

* Retail property: Shopping centres, grocery stores and outlet stores
* Industrial property: Warehouses and distribution centres
* Residential property: Student accommodation, apartment buildings and standalone homes
* Office buildings

REITs provide access to assets that may be otherwise out of reach for individual investors, such as large-scale commercial properties. 

Companies such as [AltX](https://www.altx.com.au/media/how-insto-sized-investments-open-the-door-to-diversification/) allows investors to pool their funds to provide private debt to developers and property-rish commercial borrowers. This effectively replaces the bank as a source of financing allowing developers alternative avenues for funding.

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Tech plaforms like BrickX have changed the industry in two ways: fractionalisation and distribution.

Access to fractional investing is dusputing the traditional status quo by harnessing the power of digital platforms for distribution. By breaking up investments up into smaller bundles, a much larger universe of investors suddenly have the funds to enter the market. And, by distributing offerings via platform to many investors at the same time, everyone can participate on equal footing. 

BrickX has also made accessing property within self managaged super funds (SMSFs) much easier considering the stringent rules around purchasing real property within super. SMSFs are able to conduct transactions within the BrickX platform as if they were purchasing shares or other listed securities. 

The overall business impact are the additional options of property investing now available to customers who have been priced out of the market. Customers are now able to part take in the property market for a small entry cost while they spend time saving for a property of their own. 

As BrickX is an ASIC regulated investment, it has brought into scope another asset class for financial advisers to recommend their clients. Historically, an investment property would have been quite a lumpy asset when compared to the rest of a client's investible assets. By purchasing Bricks, advisers are able to adequately diversify their client's portfolios into the direct property sector and across multiple properties. This helps investors minimise the risk of capital loss within their portfolios. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure
success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Companies in the fractional real estate investing space measure success using the following metrics:

* Company Growth: 
* Fees: BrickX charges a Buy & Sell Transaction fee of 0.5%. Domacom charges an annual management fee of 0.22% pa plus 0.44% - 0.88% pa of the gross value of your investment in their sub fund, depending on the nature of the investment. By comparison, BrickX's fees are significantly lower. 
* Assets under management (AUM): BrickX has $20M of AUM as of today <sup>4</sup>.

    Domacom's AUM reached $90M as of 16 September 2021 <sup>6</sup>. However it is a publicly traded company on the ASX and has had significantly more funding rounds than BrickX. 

    BrickX had recently been acquired by Thundering Herd, a Venture Capital & Private Equity Investment Firm who plan to expand the the existing property portfolio and also go into other categories including commercial real estate. 

* Membership base: BrickX reached 10,000 members under their investment platform as at March 2018 <sup>4</sup>.
* Minimum investment amount: BrickX is able to reach a wider range of investors by offering the industry's lowest entry point of $250 as a minimum investment <sup>4</sup>. Domacom's minimum investment required is $2,500. 
* Investment Options: BrickX offers mainly residential properties (houses and units) as we as offices as investible options to investors with a commercial property coming soon. Comparatively, Domacom offers the following strategies to their investors:
    1. Rental property accelerator - A mutually beneficial relationship between renters and investors where a portion of the property value is gifted to the tenent to assist with affordability and the investors receive a significant developer discount on the purchase price of the property.
    1. Residential Mortgage Loan - Investors can park funds in Domacom's sub fund and earn interest of 5.06% pa on their contribution. 
    1. Land Banking - Investors can participate in crowdfunding to invest in undeveloped land with a view to increasing its value overtime through holding, rezoning and developing. 
    1. Senior Equity Release - Home owners are able to sell a percentage of their home to one or more property investors in return for a lump sum or a regular payment to supplement their income. The home owner retains the title and has a permanent right of abode until the decide to sell their home.

    Comparatively, BrickX does not offer the scope of investments when compared to Domacom. However, the additional options are more suited to sophisticated investors, rather than the average retail Australian investor looking to purchase a portion of a residential property, which is the market that BrickX is focussed on.

* Performance: Brickx properties grew by 6.70% in the last 12 months ending 30 June 2021 using the most recent data <sup>7</sup> net of fees and costs. Comparatively the Australian Property Market grew by 16.8% over the last 12 months to 14 September 2021 <sup>8</sup>. No data was available on Domacom performance over this period.

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest
they offer? 

I would recommend that BrickX diversifies into different property classes such as commercial properties, land banking opportunities, international properties, equity release, infrastructure assets. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

These are potential cash cows that BrickX can capitalise on to expand their customer base and gain more market share within the fractional investment industry. 

_Commercial Properties_

BrickX speciailises in residental property within the Sydney metro area which do not provide the best rental yields due to their high purchase price. One other issue is a lack of supply of suitable properties. 

Expanding into these other markets would allow BrickX to extend its reach similar to Domacom to make inaccessible assets accessible to retail investors such as shopping centres which return an average yield of 6.85% in Q1 2021 <sup>9</sup>. Shopping Centres are also recession proof with consistent performance regardless of consumer confidence. COVID lockdowns and localisation of the workforce have meant that people are spending more time in their local areas versus the CBD. 

Shopping Centres also have long leases (+10 years) which guarantee consistent rental returns, rather than residential tenants who may move out of the property within 12 months. 
Anchor tenants such as supermarkets and large retailers attract smaller supporting tenants such as hairdressers, cafes, chemists & medical centres which complement that larger anchor tenants. 

The income streams are diversified with income streams received from multiple tenants versus the single income stream of a residential tenant. 

_Land Banking_

In a land banking scheme, property developers buy land, divide it into smaller blocks and offer it to investors. The majority of profit made on the buying and selling of land is in the acquisition of the land itself. However, these transactions are generally unknown to the average retail investor and conducted in private between developers and property syndicates. 

Finding plots of land with development opportunities also requires specific expertise to research and source the investible opportunities within the market. Considering the property growth witnessed by Sydney over the years as well as the rise of high-density living as a response to the sky high prices of dwellings, Sydney has become and attractive market for land banking. 

By expanding into Land Banking, retail investors could get in early in the property purchase phase to maximise their capital gains. 

<em>Equity Release</em>

Similar to Domacom's Equity Release option, property owners are able to sell a percentage of their home to one or more property investors in return for a lump sum or regular payment to supplement their income. Owners retain the title and have a permanent right of abode until they sell their home. 

This is an attractive option for those home owners who are asset rish and cash poor, that have a significant portion of wealth tied up in their family home and no other liquid assets. The generic solution for people in this situation is to downgrade the family home which is complicated and may result in more costs than an equity release scheme. Another option is a Reverse Mortgage however, the borrowing limit is capped at 15% - 20% of the value of your home and increases with age. The loan is repaid when your house is sold or from your estate. The disadvantage to the owner is that the interest rates on the Reverse Mortgage are circe 5.60% pa which is double the current market home loan interest rate. 

Under the equity release scheme, homeowners are able to access equity within their family home as well as continuing to reside there which is an attractive solution for those not wanting to part with the family home. 

Australia is a significant part of the global equity release trend. With the equity release market expected to triple over the next decade <sup>10</sup>, BrickX would position themselves at the forefront of client demand. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

_Crowdfunding_

Crowdfunding will continue to be a main driver of generating sufficient capital to purchase the target projects. It enables investors with insufficient funds to acquire property by themselves to pool their funds with likeminded investors and purchase as a group, with fractional ownership. 

_Big Data_

Big Data will play a big part in prospecting potential property projects. As mentioned earlier, Big Data can provide a more granular level of information that differs to traditional sources such as RP Data. Examples of this non-trational type of data include:

* Property evaluations - BrickX's analysts can base their property evaluations on data points such as curreny supply, and demand, sales volume, property characteristics, the fluctuating cost of construction. Big Data has the ability to make appraisals bases on years of market data, making it a tool for BrickX analysts to accurately value a property for acquisition. 

* Property development - AI can be trained to pinpoint land parcels ripe for a high-yielding investment with inputs such as Local Government records showing infrastructure developments, or trends on social media groups showing increased interest from in a specific area. 

_Artificial Intelligence_

Artificial Intelligence can be used in to interpret the information collected via Big Data to provide real estate intelligence about the environment. AI can detact trends such as neighbourhood gentrification to target potential areas for development. 

AI is also able to analyse data for completed real estate deals across multiple asset classes to predict trends and changes in value to back the right investments. This type of computing power would be invaluable for picking the right properties or development spots for acquisition.
